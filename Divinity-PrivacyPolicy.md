# Privacy Policy for Divinity AI App

## Introduction
Welcome to Divinity, an AI application designed to provide spiritual guidance through conversations with an AI priest. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our application.

## Information Collection
When you use Divinity, we request microphone access to enable voice conversations with our AI priest. This permission is essential for the core functionality of our application.

## How We Use Your Information

- **No Recording Storage**: We do not store or retain any recordings of your conversations on our servers. Voice data is processed transiently and is not preserved after the interaction is complete.

## Data Security
Since we do not store your voice recordings, there is minimal risk of voice data exposure. However, we implement industry-standard security measures to protect any other information that might be processed during your use of the application.

## Third-Party Services
Our application may use third-party services for voice-to-text conversion. These services process your voice data according to their own privacy policies, though the data is not stored long-term.

- Choosing when to enable or disable microphone access
- Ending conversations at any time
- Requesting information about what data we hold about you (if any)
